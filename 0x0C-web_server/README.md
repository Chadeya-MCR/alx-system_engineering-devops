For this project  we will be tackling the following:
=> Write a Bash script that transfers a file from the client to Server
=> Installign a Web server, that servers HTML pages 
Set up a domain
=> Configure Nginx Server so that /redirect_me is redirectign to another page.
=> Configure the Nginx Server to have a custom 404 page that contain the string Ceci n'est pas une page.
=> Time to practice configuring your server with Puppet! Just as you did before, weâ€™d like you to install and configure an Nginx server using Puppet instead of Bash. To save time and effort, you should also include resources in your manifest to perform a 301 redirect when querying /redirect_me.
